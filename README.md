Vaping mod based on arduino pro mini with thermocontrol and other functions

This mod works with 2S (two cells) Li-Ion/PO batteries. I've used one for RC models - 25/35C 500 mAh. Resistor R5 should be 0.25 watts at least. 

There small error on the schematics - minus button should be connected to D2, not D12. The "LED" output is for flashlight's leds.
